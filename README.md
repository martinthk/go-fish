# Go Fish
A card game that uses a standard 52 card deck and can be played with 2 people or more.

## Object of the game
The goal is to win the most "books" of cards. A book is any four of a kind, such as four kings, four aces, and so on.

## Start at the Game
7 cards are dealt to each player from a standard deck of 52 cards.

## Each Turn
The player whose turn it is to play asks another player for his/her cards of a particular face value. 

1. The first player asks the second player for a card of a particular value. They must ask for a card of the same value as one of the cards in their hand.
2. If the second player has a card of that value, they will remove it from their hand and give it to them. If they do not have one, they will tell the player to “Go Fish!”. This means the first player must take a new card from the deck.
3. If the first player was successful in asking for a card, they can ask for another card. This continues until they are told to “Go Fish”, at which point the second player will then start the process of asking for a card.
4. If a player gets four cards of the same value (it forms a "book") they reveal the set to the other player, score 1 point, and remove those cards from their hand.
5. If at some point a player has no cards in their hand, they take seven new cards from the deck (or as many as left if there are less than seven).
6. The game continues until all sets of cards are formed. The player with the most points
wins.

## Winning the Game
When all sets of cards have been laid down in books, the game ends. The player with the most points wins.

## Example 
Alice may ask, "Bob, do you have any threes?" (Alice must have at least one card of the rank she requested). Bob must hand over all cards of that rank if possible. If he has none, Bob tells Alice to "go fish", and Alice draws a card from the pool and places it in her own hand. Then it is the next player's turn – unless the card Alice drew is the card she asked for, in which case she shows it to the other players, and she gets another turn. 

## Rank of Cards
The cards rank from ace (high) to two (low). The suits are not important, only the card numbers are relevant, such as two 3s, two 10s, and so on.
